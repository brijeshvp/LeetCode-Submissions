// ind ptr -> at last of num1(m+n-1) to put largest elts there
// i = m-1(actual last elt of num1) and j = n-1(last elt of num2)
// compare num1 and num2 -> place larger elts at ind(elt)
// in this ques -> 1st array size = m+n(easy problem)
// also solve(gfg hard problem -> merge two sorted arrays without extra space -> both array size = m and n respectively)
